# Tutorial 02

In this tutorial we create the most basic of vertex and fragment shaders files, go over how to compile them to SPIR-V, and read
the compiled files into our c++ program, to later be used to create shader modules in the next tutorial.

## Building

Follow the steps in tutorial 0 that go over how to set up your development environment. Next create a directory for your project and copy the contents of this tutorial into your directory. Rename .env-example to .env and enter the path to where you installed the vulkan sdk.

Build the project using make, and run. You should see an empty window appear.
