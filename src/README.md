# Tutorial

Each time I record a new video, this is the directory I'm working in, and therefore represents the current state of the tutorial series. It also means that the git diff between each tutorial will be easily visible in the github network history.

## Building

Create a directory for your project and copy the contents of tutorial to your directory. Rename .env-example to .env and enter the path to where you installed the vulkan sdk.

Build the project using make, and run. You should see an empty window appear.
